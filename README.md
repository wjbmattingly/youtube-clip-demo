# About the Repository

This repository houses the code used to create an [Annoy Index](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) of [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) embedded images. The CLIP model was used via the [Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) library. It also has the code for querying that index with encoded text.
