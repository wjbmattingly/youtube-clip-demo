# About the Repository

This repository houses the code used to create an [Annoy Index](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) of [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) embedded images. The CLIP model was used via the [Sentence Transformer](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) library. The images used in this repository are medieval manuscripts and were gathered from [E-Codices](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en).

This repository also has the code for querying the Annoy index with an encoded text-based query. This allows a user to search a database of images with text.
